### how to play
Look at an orange block to see the icons of what you can be. Look at an icon to populate the world with that thing. Look at the blue box to start and stop camera movement. Once the camera is moving just look around and you will move to that place.

### dependencies
It uses A-Frame, Node.js, Socket.io

### Installing
download and run npm install 

### To do
* create components for the javascript
* make more random position for trees but so they don't intersect or cover the menu
* add more elements you can be such as birds, animals, rain
* add more interaction when certain things are picked. At the moment if you pick day and night you get dawn. Maybe sun and rain would produce a rainbow
* create sounds and music for the elements
* put each element into a component, maybe use react
* optimize code
* optimize images and objects
* change the lighting depending on what's picked
